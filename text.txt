In this project, it is aimed to evaluate the performance of potential predictive models utilizing the earlydisease
clinical data and guessing if a patient would need intensive care support or intubation. A published clinical dataset is 
provided for this task.For this purpose, using the data features 
(laboratory and clinical values of the patients) the state of these patients 
(intensive care support, intubation) will be predicted separately. Random forest and Gradient Boosted Trees algorithms will 
be used as the predictive models.
